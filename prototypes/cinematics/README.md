Cinematic Prototype Requirements:

   
   Non-interactive cinematic: SATISFIED
        
   Main studio cinematic satisfies this requirement (Fridge zooms in, text shows and does animation, fridge zooms out and cinematic finishes)
   
   Interactive cinematic: SATISFIED
        
   The main title menu screen with interactive buttons where when held they expand and change tint and shrink back and advance the scene when clicked.
  
   Choreography in code: SATISFIED
        
   Studio intro uses many chained event callbacks (onComplete's), also the door moves down and does callback to allow player to move after user clicks play.
